size  of  the  particular  ethnic/caste  group  is  lower  than  that  of  the  mother  tongue  speakers  (see,,
"Table 3.16) . For example, a large number of Yehlmo population lives in the Helambu areas of",,
,Sindhupalchok  district  and  these  populations  must  have  recorded  as  Sherpas.  Two  explanations,
,"can be forwarded.  First, the CBS enumerators, without even asking the ethnic identity of people,",
,"simply labeled Yehlmo as Sherpa as they look physically and culturally similar with the Sherpa,",
,and    ii)  Many  of  these  Yehlmo  populations    simply  wanted  to  record  themselves  as  Sherpa,
,instead  of  Yehlmo.  The  reason  is  obvious.  A  Sherpa  name  is  more  popular  and  prestigious  in,
,Nepal and outside world than the Yehlmo. But it is not known why the Yehlmo wanted to record,
,"their  language  as  Yehlmo.  Likewise,  the  ethnic  Bangali  population  is  quite  large  and  many  of",
,"them live in Jhapa, Morang and Parsa districts. It is likely that many of them wanted to identify",
,themselves as Nepali (politically they do not want to label them as Bangali) but at the same time,
speak Bengali as their mother tongue at home.,,

Population Census, 2001, CBS, Nepal",,
,"In Nepal, any Rai person knows that there are several distinct cultural groups within the Rai with",
,"different  languages  and  cultural  traditions.  Normally,  there  are  more  than  20  distinct  cultural",
,"groups  within  Rai.  But  ethnically,  the  Rai  is  treated  as  one  cultural  group  in  the  2001  census",
,"whereas  they  are  treated  differently  in  terms  of  their  mother-tongue.  For  example,  the  CBS",
,"identified 8 separate mother-tongue groups within the Rai (Bantawa, Thulung, Sampang, Khaling,",
,"Nachring,  Yamphu,  Lhorung  and  Mewahang).  Again,  there  is  an  ambiguity  in  terms  of  Ghale",
,"mother-tongue.    Although often  claiming  separate  status,  Ghale  also  can  appear  as  a  clan  name",
