"3.1 
Introduction"
"In Nepal, though the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) already conducted ten decennial censuses"
"since  1911, 
the 
taking  of  census  considering 
the  social  components  of  population  such  as"
"language,  religion  and  ethnic/  caste  groups  is  relatively  a  recent  phenomenon.  The  inclusion  of"
"these  social  components 
in 
the  Nepali  census  gradually  started  along  with 
the  advent  of"
democratic  revolutions  in  Nepal.  The  democratic  revolution  in  Nepal  in  1950(which  threw  the
autocratic  Rana  regime)  motivated  to  include  two  important  social  components  in  the  census
taking; the 1952/54 census provided information on language (on the basis of mother tongue) and
religion. The other important social component such as caste/ethnicity was included only in the
1991  census  after  the  onset  of  democracy  in  Nepal  in  1990  (the  king  became  the  constitutional
monarch). There could be several reasons why the CBS has remained little skeptical throughout
"its history in providing such important data on language, religion and caste/ethnicity."
"Sensitive  Nature  of  the  Data:  The  Central  Bureau  of  Statistics  (CBS)  is  a  government 
•"
"organization.  Before  1950,  the  Rana  government  wanted  to  show  Nepal  as  a  homogenous"
"country in terms of language, religion and ethnic/caste structure. The government advocated"
the single language and religion policy within the framework of larger Hindu nationalism and
"ideals.  Considering  the  sensitive  nature  of  the  data,  which  could  harm  the  larger  Hindu"
"nationalist  sentiments,  the  government  did  not encourage  the  CBS  to  publish such  sensitive"
"data, though the CBS started collecting such data since the 1911 census in different formats."
The CBS continued collecting the caste/ethnicity data up to the 1952/54 census but they never
published  them  officially.  Not  only  that  the  CBS  simply  deleted  the  question  column  on
"caste/ethnicity  in  the    1961  ,  1971  and  1981  censuses,  considering    such  data    are  not  very"
useful for planning purposes.
"•
 
Politically  Unstable  Government:  After  1950,  the  frequent  changes  in  the  government"
structure  and  the  short-  life  of  the  elected  democratic  government  in  1959-60  could  not
"provide  enough 
space 
for 
the  people.  The  Panchayat 
regime 
(1960-1990)  absolutely"
maintained  Hindu  supremacy  and  values  and  did  not  provide  space  for  the  participatory

"political culture of people considering their language, religion and culture. So it is natural that"
the democratic government formed after 1990 encouraged the CBS to provide information on
caste / ethnicity in Nepal.
"•
  Macro policy and lack of vision in understanding Nepali society and culture: Even today,"
"many politicians, planners and academics think that the development of Nepal is possible only"
from  the  macro  perspective.    Many  of  them  believe  that  detailed  information  on  various
groups of people could lead towards disintegration than integration of Nepal. Because of this
"kind  of  pungent  feeling  of  national  integration  and  vision  of  development,  there  is  still  a"
"strong tendency in Nepal to provide information on macro framework, particularly about the"
Nepali  society  and  culture  or  present  development  model  as  if  all  cultural  groups  are  the
same.

,Nepali  society  and  culture  or  present  development  model  as  if  all  cultural  groups  are  the
same.,
"In Nepal, every census is considered an improvement of the previous census in terms of providing",
scientific information to the people. But the census of 2001 has to face some serious problem in,
collecting the household- level individual data in many areas of Nepal. The CBS could not collect,
the household- level individual data in 80 villages of eight Maoist insurgency affected districts:,
"Salyan,  Kalikot,  Jhapa,  Surkhet,  Mugu,  Humla,  Jumla  ,  Dolpa  and  Sindhupalchok.  The  most",
affected  district  was  Salyan  where,"the  CBS  could  provide 
the  detailed  household-level"
"information  only  on  28  Village  Development  Committees  (VDCs)  (out  of  total  47  VDCs).  In,",
"brief,  though  4,253,220  households  and  23,151,423  populations  were  recorded  in  the  2001-",
"census,  detailed  household-level","individual  characteristics 
(such  as 
religion,  caste/ethnicity,"
"literacy,","language  and  so  on)  are  available  only  for  4,174,374  households  and  22,736,934"
populations.,
"Keeping  such  background  information  in  mind,  this  chapter  attempts  to  provide  a  systematic",
overview of the social composition of population of Nepal. Three sets of data are discussed for,
"this  purpose:  ethnic/caste  composition,  language  and  religion.  As  language  has  been  covered  in",
"another chapter, this chapter brings language only for reference or cross-tabulation.",
3.2,Ethnic /Caste Composition of Nepal
"Historically, it is difficult to provide the reliable information on ethnic /caste groups of Nepal for",
"two  reasons:  i)  History  of  unified  Nepal  begins  only  after  1768,  and  ii)  No  anthropological/",
linguistic survey has been carried out in Nepal to date to note the various ethnic/caste groups and,
their mother tongues.,
"Before  the  conquest  of  Kathmandu  Valley  by  King Prthivinarayan  Shah  in  1768,  the  history  of",
Nepal was the history of small kingdoms and principalities ruled by different kings and chiefs. In,


0
"the east, there were three major kingdoms- Bijaypur, Chaudandi and Makwanpur.  In the kingdom"
"like  Bijayapur,  there  were  various  groups  of  peoples  such  as  the  Rai,  Limbu,  Sunuwar,  Lepcha"
"and others. To the west of Kathmandu, there were the Chaubise  (twenty-four) kingdoms and in"
"the  far  west  across  the  Kanali  river,  there  were  the  Baise  (twenty  two)  kingdoms(  see  Acharya"
"1968).  If  the  Khas  and  other  groups  were  living  in  the  far-  western  Hills,  Magar,  Gurung  and"
"others were living in the western Hill regions. Tharus, Dhimals, Rajbansi and others were living"
"in 
the  Tarai.  Similarly, 
the  Kathmandu  Valley,  which 
included 
three  small  kingdoms,was"
"inhabited  mostly  by  the  Newars.  In  brief,  Nepal  became  a  multi-cultural,  multi-religious  and"
multi-lingual state only after the unification of Nepal in 1768 and subsequent consolidation of the
state thereafter.
As no anthropological/linguistic survey has been carried out in Nepal to date to note the various
"ethnic/caste groups, their distribution and population size, the exact number of ethnic/caste groups"
and  their  population  size  is  somewhat  imprecise  in  Nepal  even  today.  In  this  kind  of  uncertain
"situation,  the  CBS  has  remained  the  single  most  important  reliable  source  in  providing  the"
national- level information on caste/ethnicity and their various socioeconomic characteristics. The
"CBS provided data on 59 ethnic/caste groups in the 1991 census, whereas it provided data on 100"
ethnic  /caste  groups  in  the  2001  census  (see  Annex  3.1  for  details  regarding  the  ethnic/caste
"composition of Nepal in the 1991 and 2001 censuses).  Despite these available  information, many"
"agencies  provide 
their  own 
information  on  ethnic/caste  groups  and 
thus 
the  number  of"
"ethnic/caste groups and their population size differ from one source to another. For example, the"
National Committee of Nationalities (2002) listed 59 distinct cultural groups within Janajati and
Dalit Commission (Ayog)  (2002) noted 28 cultural groups within Dalits1.
"The focus of this paper, however, is to provide information on caste/ ethnicity and religion on the"
"basis  of  the  2001  census  and  to  assess  its  quality  of  the  data,  scope  and  limitation.  Before"
discussing  the  basic  features  of  ethnic/  caste  composition  of  population  on  the  basis  of  2001
"census,  let  me  briefly  discuss  the  distinct  cultural  characteristics  of  various  groups  of  people"
"living in Nepal, so that these  census data on ethnic/caste groups could be discussed in a proper"
anthropological/sociological perspective.
"In Nepal, though there are more than 100 ethnic/caste groups with distinct language and culture,"
these  diverse  ethnic/caste  groups  can  be  arranged  into  five  broad  cultural  groups:    i)  the  caste-
"origin Hindu groups; ii) the Newar, iii) the Janajati or nationalities, iv) Muslim or Musalman and"
v) Other (see Dahal 1995).

"3.2.1 
Caste Origin Hindu Groups"
The caste-origin Hindu groups have some distinct cultural features: i) hierarchical structure (one
group  is  placed  at  the  top  and  the  other  is  placed  at  the  bottom;  ii)  hereditary  basis  of  the
"membership;  iii)  endogamy  (marrying  within  one’s  own  cultural  group)  and,  iv)  purity  and"
"pollution, which govern the day- to- day life of people. There are three distinct caste-origin Hindu"
"groups in Nepal: i) Caste origin Hill Hindus, ii) Caste origin Tarai Hindus, and, iii) Caste-origin"
Hindu Newar.
"3.2.1.1 
Caste - Origin Hill Hindu groups"
"The  social  structure  of  caste-origin  Hill  Hindu  groups  is  simple,  reflecting  only  three  groups  in"
hierarchy and there is no four Varna (color) within this category.
"i) 
High caste Hindu groups: Brahmin, Thakuri and Chhetri"
"ii) 
Middle caste Hindu group: Sanyasi"
"iii) 
Low caste Hindu groups or Dalits: Kami , Sarki, Damai, Badi and Gaine"
"The mother tongue of these groups is the Nepali language. The CBS, 2001 recorded only 9 groups"
in the caste-origin Hill Hindu groups.
"3.2.1.2 
Caste - Origin Tarai Hindu Groups"
"The  social  structure  of  the  caste-origin  Tarai  Hindu  groups  is  complex,  reflecting  four  Varna"
"groups  with  distinct  hierarchical  structure  within  them:  Brahmin  (Maithil  Brahmin,  Bhumihar),"
"Chhetri(Rajput), Vaisya ( Yadav, Kayastha, , Halwaii, Hajam, Sonar, Lohar, Rajbhar and others)"
"and  Sudra  or  untouchable(  Tatma,  Bantar,  Mushahar,Chamar,  Dom  and  others).  These  various"
"cultural groups belong to four distinct language groups: Maithili, Bajika, Bhojpuri, and Awadhi."
"The CBS, 2001 recorded 43 caste- origin Hindu groups in the Tarai."
"3.2.2 
Newar"
The case of Newar is exceptional. This group not only presents the complicated social structure
"among  all  groups  in  Nepal,  truly  reflecting  the  model  of  four  Hindu  Varna  categories  and  is"
clearly  divided  into  two  distinct  religious  groups:  the  Hindu  and  the  Buddhist.    Newars  are
"divided 
internally 
into  more 
than  40  distinct  cultural  groups  with  different  occupational"
"categories,  though  they  share  a  common  language  (mother-tongue)  Newari.  The  CBS  recorded"
Newar only as one cultural group.

"3.2.3 
Janajati (Ethnic Groups /Nationalities)"
"A  Janajti  group  or  nationality  as  defined  by 
the  National  Committee  for  Development  of"
Nationalities  (1996) is as follows:
“Nationality (Janajati) is that community which has its own mother tongue and traditional culture
and yet do not fall under the conventional four fold Varna of Hindu or Hindu hierarchical caste
structure.  A Janajati group has the following characteristics:
"A distinct collective identity 
•"
"Own language, religion, tradition, culture and civilization; own traditional egalitarian social 
•"
structure
"Traditional homeland or geographical area 
•"
"Written or oral history 
•"
"Having “ we-feeling”; 
•"
"Have had no decisive role in politics and government in modern Nepal; 
•"
"Who declare themselves as Janajati    
•"
"Historically,  many  of  these  Janajati  groups  used  to  occupy  a  particular  habitat  or  territory,  and"
thus many of them claim that they are the true “ First Settlers” (Adivasi) of Nepal. Like the caste
"Hindus, the Janajati can also be divided into two distinct regional groups: Hill Janajati and Tarai"
Janajati.
"Some of the Hill Janajati groups are: Magar, Gurung, Rai, Limbu, Sherpa, Sunuwar, Bhote, Raji,"
Raute and others.
"Some of the Tarai Janajati groups are: Tharu, Dhimal, Gangain, Satar/Santhal, Dahngar/Jhangar,"
"Koche, Meche and others."
The  National  Committee  of  Nationalities  which  noted  59  distinct  cultural  groups  as  Janajati
"(published 
in  Nepal  Rajpatra,  February  2,2002)  also 
identified 
them 
in  different  ecological"
"regions: 18 groups from the Mountain, 23 groups from the Hill and 7 groups from the Inner Tarai"
"and 11 groups from the Tarai. Of them, the CBS could record only 42 Janajati groups with their"
"population  size  and  the  population  size  of  other  17  groups  (13  from  the  Mountain,  3  from  the"
"Hills  and  1  from  the  Tarai)  is  not  available.  According  to  Grurung  (2002:  12),  of  the  total  18"
"Janajati  groups  listed  in  the  Mountain  (or  Himal),  the  CBS  recorded  only  five  groups  (Bhote,"
"Byanshi, Sherpa, Thakali and Walung) and the rest other groups are labeled as Bhote or they are"
"simply  the  identification  of  the  group  through  Tibetan  language.  Likewise,  Gurung  (2002:  13)"
"claims that “Free” is the group related with Pahari, Surel with Jirel and Bankariya with Chepang."
"The Newar group, whose Hindu population is more than 84% according to the 2001 census (see"


0,1,2
,"Annex  3.4),  and  who  are  strictly  hierarchical  in  their  structure,  is  also  labeled  as  Janajati.",
"Similarly,  97.6  percent  of  the  Tharu  populations  follow  Hindu  religion,  according  to  the  2001",,
census.,,
The above list of Janajati suggests that identity of Janajati is extremely elusive and often arbitrary,,
in the context of Nepal.,,
"3.2.4 
Musalman",,
,The CBS recorded two cultural groups within Musalman:  i) Musalman and ii) Churoute. If the,
"big Musalman populations live in the Tarai, the small Hill Musalman group, popularly known as",,
"Churoute, lives in the Western hill districts.",,
"3.2.5 
Other",,
,"In  addition,  a  small  number  of  religious  and  social  groups  such  as  Sikh/Punjabi,  Bangali,",
,"Marwari,  and  Jain(reported  as  Jaine  by  the  CBS)  live  mostly  in  the  urban  areas  of  Nepal.  Only",
four such groups are recorded by the CBS.,,

"Numerically, only 11 groups are dominant in certain districts of Nepal. The Bahuns and Chhetris"
"are  not  only  the  largest  group  numerically,  but  also  highest  in  number  in  10  and  21  districts,"

of 
the 
Kathmandu

(Kathmandu,

(mostly  in  the  far-  western  Tarai).  This  suggests  that  Tharus  are  spread  over  in  good  numbers
from  the  west  to  the  east  of  the  Nepal  Tarai  districts.  The  numerically  dominant  Hindu  origin

in five districts of the Eastern and Central Tarai regions. The Muslim population is found highest,
in number in five districts in the 2001 census though their number was highest only in 4 districts,
in  the  1991  census  (Rautahat  district  is  added  in  the  2001  census).  Though  Kami  ranked  8th  in,
"population size in the 2001census, they do not stand on number 1 position in population size in",
any district of Nepal; they numbered second in Jajarkot and Bajura districts. This further suggests,
that Kamis are distributed in good numbers in most of the districts of Nepal.,
The  other  interesting  finding  of  Annex  3.2  is  the  nature  of  homogeneity/heterogeneity  of  the,
population  in  terms  of  ethnic/caste  groups  in  various  districts  of  Nepal.  Most  of  the  Hill  and,
Mountain districts are relatively homogenous composition in their group representation compared,
"to the Tarai districts. In other words, there is not much diversity in ethnicity in the districts of the",
"Hills and Mountain regions. Looking at the four most represented groups within a given district,",
"the 
population 
of 
four 
represented 
groups 
fluctuates 
between 
57.9","percent 
(lowest 
in"
"Sankhuwasabha  district)  to  91.0  Percent  (highest  in  Bhaktapur  district).  Similarly,  there  are  a",
,number of Mountain and Hill districts whose population size of four most represented ethnic/caste
groups  exceeds  more  than  88%  of  the  total  population.  Such  districts  are:,"Rolpa  (90.9%),"
"Sindhupalchok  (90.8%),  Rukum  (90.6%),  Darchula  (89.6%),  Rasuwa  (89.6%),  and  Bajhyang",
(88.2%).,
The  Nepal  Tarai  is  more  heterogeneous  in  terms  of  ethnic/caste  composition.  Except  the  far,
western  two  Tarai  districts  such  as  Kailali  (78.0  %)  and  Kanchanpur  (70.8%)  and  the  eastern,
"Tarai district such as Jhapa (55.6%), rest other districts of the Tarai have hardly 44% of the total",
population if the population size of four most representative ethnic /caste groups is combined. The,
three Tarai districts where more homogenous nature of the ethnic/caste composition of population,
"is  observed  because  of 
the 
large  number  of  Tharu  populations 
in",the  far  west(Kailali  and
Kanchanpur) and mostly the Hill populations in Jhapa district.,
"Considering  the  four  most  represented  groups  within  a  given  district,  the  most  heterogeneous",
"districts in Tarai are: Sarlahi (36.0%), Dhanusa (37.3),  Morang (37.2%), Parsa (38.2%), and Bara",
"(40.15%).  Based on the 1991 census data, Subedi (2002) also lists 14 districts of the Tarai, which",
have the most heterogeneous population in terms of ethnic/ caste structure.,
There  are  several  reasons  why  the  Tarai  is  relatively  heterogeneous  in  terms  of  ethnic/caste,
composition: i) the Tarai caste- groups as a whole are more stratified in social structure than the,
Hill  caste  groups;  ii)  the  heavy  migration  of  population  in  the  Tarai  from  the  Hill  districts  and,
India over the last 40 years further increased the ethnic/caste diversity in the Tarai. The malaria,
eradication program and development of markets and roads in the Tarai after the 1960s motivated,
a large number of the hill and Indian populations to settle in the Tarai.,

Rural/Urban Population by Ethnic/Caste Groups"
"According  to  the  2001  census,  only  13.9%  of  the  total  populations  are  urban  in  Nepal.    While"
"considering the urban/ rural population by ethnic/ caste groups, it is interesting to note that some"
number of every ethnic/caste group is found in almost all the urban areas of Nepal.  This is simply
because of the amalgamation of many rural areas to declare an urban area in Nepal (see Sharma
"1989, Bastola 1995). Ten most urban ethnic/caste groups in Nepal are as follows (Table 3.7)."

"It  is  obvious  that  cultural  groups  such  as  Jain,  Marwari,  Newar,  Bangali  and  Thakali  are  the"
established business communities in Nepal. They live mostly in the urban centers and thus their
percentage  in  urban  is  higher.  But  the  other  interesting  fact  is  that  certain  ethnic/caste  groups
"whose  social,  economic  and  political  situations  are  lower  compared  to  other  groups  (such  as"
"Brahmin and Chhetri ), their percentage of being urban people is higher than them. Such urban"
"groups  reported  by  the  census  are:  Halkhor  (a  sweeper  community  of  the  Tarai),  Munda  (a"
Janajati group recently migrated from India; they are farmers and make a living by farming and
"doing wage labor), Chidimar (make a living by killing/selling birds) and Gaine (a low caste Hindu"
group  who  makes  a  living  by  playing  musical  instruments  and  singing  songs).  Some  plausible
explanation for this could be as follows. As many hinter- lands between the urban and rural area
"are converted into the urban area by the government in recent years, people living in such areas"
"automatically  became  urban.  The  economically  marginal  groups  such  as  Chidimar,  Gaine,"


0
Halkhor  and  Munda  live  in  such  hinterlands  as  they  build  relationships  with  people  in  both  the
rural and the urban area. The higher percentage of  urban population in the Chidimar and  Gaine
"groups could be due to their profession as well. As Chidimar, by profession, trap or kill birds and"
sell them in the market area (urban area) they stay mostly in the market area for livelihood.  Many
"Munda people also confine themselves in the market areas as laborers to make a living. Similarly,"
the  Gaine  sing  songs  with  their  traditional  musical  instruments  (known  as  Sarangi)  and  confine
"themselves in the urban area to make a living.  Halkhor, a low caste untouchable community of"
"the Nepal Tarai, do the sweeping and cleaning jobs in the urban and city areas of the Nepal Tarai"
and live there as well. The other reason could be their number itself. As their number is relatively
"low, their low number in the city area could inflate the percentage."
"Likewise,  the  least  urban  ethnic/caste  groups  in  Nepal  are:  Gangain  (1.1%),  Chepang  (1.5%)."
"Tajpuria (1.6%), Yelhmo (1.6%) and Koche (1.8%). All of them belong to the Janajati groups and"
do farming confining themselves  mostly in the rural area.
"3.3.5 
Literacy by Ethnic/Caste groups"
"According  to  the  2001  census,  the  literacy  rate  of  Nepal  is  53.8  percent;  the  male  and  female"
"literacy rate is 65 percent and 42.5 percent, respectively.  No doubt, the literacy rate of Nepal is"
"improving gradually over the years by sex. At the same time, the literacy rate as a whole differs"
significantly  by  ethnic/  caste  groups  and  sex.  As  the  literacy  and  other  related  components  are

Christian population. Though Tamangs follow Buddhism and Chepangs are animist by tradition,,
"(see  Rai  1985),  they  are  gradually  converting  themselves  into  Christianity  as  they  find  more",,

"3.4.5 
Islam as Religion",,
The only religion whose number and percentage is constantly increasing over the last 50 years is,,
,Islam.  Only  2.54%  of  total  people  in  Nepal  were  recorded  as  Islam  during  the  1952/54  census,
,which increased to 4.20 percent in the 2001 census.  In Nepal only the Musalman follows Islam as,
,"their religion.  According to the 2001 census, the total Musalman population (including the Hill",
,"Muslim, Churoute) is  975,949 and the  population of  Islam  religious followers is  954,023 or",
,97.8% of the total Musalman population. It is difficult to think a Muslim without having Islam as,


0,1
their religious faith. It is not known why the other 2.2% of Musalman population did not mention,
Islam as their religion.,
3.4.6,Population Size of the Respective Group vs. Number of Religious
,Followers
"In  addition,  the  2001  census  has  identified  more  population  in  their  respective  religious  group",
than their actual population size . Two such groups noted are: Jain and Punjabi/Sikh (see Table,
3.15).,

Source :,"Population Census, 2001, CBS, Nepal."
Though  one  can  understand  that  a  person  of  particular  ethnic/caste  group  can  switch  over  to,
"another religion, the case of Jain or Punjabi/Sikh is special. Only a real Punjabi or Sikh or Jain",
"person could follow their particular religion. The people who follow Sikhism, they have their own",
priest  (Granthi)  and  Gurudwara  (the  house  of  worship).  A  Khalsa  Sikh  (followers  of  Guru,
"Gobinda  Singh)  will  always  have  at  least  five  ""K""  symbol  with  them  such  as  Kanga  (comb),",
"Karna (the waistband), Kes (unnshorn hair), Keski (turban) and Kirpan (sword). Likewise, a pure",
Jain person has many restrictions in his day- to- day life. The most important one is that a Jain,
person  should  be  a  pure  vegetarian.  It  is  likely  that  some  members  of  these  groups  must  have,
concealed  their  own  ethnic  identity  or  enumerators  must  have  reported  them  in  some  other,
ethnic/caste category.,
3.5,Ethnic/Caste Groups vs. Mother-Tongue Speakers
"Technically,  a  member  of  particular  ethnic/caste  group  can  switch  over  to  another  language",
because of the continuous interaction with members of other language groups.  Typical example,
is  the  increasing  number  of  speakers  in  the  Nepali  language.  A  significant  population  of  many,


0,1,2
,"distinct  cultural  groups  (such  as  Newar,  Magar  and  others)  reported  Nepali  language  as  their",
,mother tongue because of their continuous interaction with the Hill Nepali language speakers. In,
,"addition, migration of a person to a new place always motivated him to speak the local language",
,"of people. Over the generations, some groups may not even speak their own mother tongue and it",
,is likely that such language may die sooner or little latter. But the ethnicity of the group will not,
normally  die  while  switching  over  to  another  language  unless  the  number  of  the  group  is  very,,
small. One of the serious problems in the data collection and reporting is that the total population,,
size  of  the  particular  ethnic/caste  group  is  lower  than  that  of  the  mother  tongue  speakers  (see,,
"Table 3.16) . For example, a large number of Yehlmo population lives in the Helambu areas of",,
,Sindhupalchok  district  and  these  populations  must  have  recorded  as  Sherpas.  Two  explanations,
,"can be forwarded.  First, the CBS enumerators, without even asking the ethnic identity of people,",
,"simply labeled Yehlmo as Sherpa as they look physically and culturally similar with the Sherpa,",
,and    ii)  Many  of  these  Yehlmo  populations    simply  wanted  to  record  themselves  as  Sherpa,
,instead  of  Yehlmo.  The  reason  is  obvious.  A  Sherpa  name  is  more  popular  and  prestigious  in,
,Nepal and outside world than the Yehlmo. But it is not known why the Yehlmo wanted to record,
,"their  language  as  Yehlmo.  Likewise,  the  ethnic  Bangali  population  is  quite  large  and  many  of",
,"them live in Jhapa, Morang and Parsa districts. It is likely that many of them wanted to identify",
,themselves as Nepali (politically they do not want to label them as Bangali) but at the same time,
speak Bengali as their mother tongue at home.,,

,"In Nepal, any Rai person knows that there are several distinct cultural groups within the Rai with",
,"different  languages  and  cultural  traditions.  Normally,  there  are  more  than  20  distinct  cultural",
,"groups  within  Rai.  But  ethnically,  the  Rai  is  treated  as  one  cultural  group  in  the  2001  census",
,"whereas  they  are  treated  differently  in  terms  of  their  mother-tongue.  For  example,  the  CBS",
,"identified 8 separate mother-tongue groups within the Rai (Bantawa, Thulung, Sampang, Khaling,",
,"Nachring,  Yamphu,  Lhorung  and  Mewahang).  Again,  there  is  an  ambiguity  in  terms  of  Ghale",
,"mother-tongue.    Although often  claiming  separate  status,  Ghale  also  can  appear  as  a  clan  name",

3.6,Conclusion
•,"Historically,  Nepal  is  a  multi-ethnic  nation  with  diverse  languages,  religions  and  cultural"
,traditions. The democratic movements of 1950 and 1990 motivated a change in the status
,"quo  of 
the  CBS  by  encouraging 
them 
to  document 
that  diversity  by  collecting  and"
,"publishing  data  on  caste/ethnicity,  language,  and  religion  in  Nepal.  Here,  the  1991  and"
,2001 censuses deserve special attention as the primary sources in providing basic figures on
,the population size and socioeconmic characteristics of the various ethnic/caste groups.
•,"In  spite  of  the  clear  diversity  in  ethnic/caste  composition  of  Nepal's  population,  the  1991"
,and 2001 census data demonstrate that nearly 70% of the population total belongs to just
,"ten major groups. The Hill Brahmin, Chhetri and Thakuri by themselves account for 30%"
,"of  the  total  population,  with  Chhetri  and  Brahmin  alone  comprising  the  largest  single"
,"cluster in 31 districts (41.3%) of Nepal. Within the whole country, the Chhetri group is the"
,"largest 
in  size  while  at 
the  other  extreme 
the  Kusunda  group  ranks  as 
the  100th 
in"
,population.  The  2001  census  allows  a  count  of  these  smallest  groups.  The  thirty-two
,"smallest ethnic/caste groups (from Kusunda to Chidimar, see Annex 3.1) altogether account"
,for  just  0.71%  of  Nepal's  total  population.  There  are  ten  distinct  cultural  groups  whose
,population  size  is  less  than  0.1  percent  of  the  whole  population.  Some  of  these  smallest
,"cultural  groups  by  number  include  Kusunda,  Patharkata/  Kushwadia,  Munda,  Raute,  and"
,Yehlmo.
•,"Most  of 
the  Hill  and  Mountain  districts  are 
relatively  homogenous 
in 
their  group"
,representation compared to the Nepal Tarai districts as a whole. Looking at the four most
,"represented groups within a given district, the hill district of Bhaktapur has the highest level"
,of such homogeneity with 91% of its population restricted to four caste/ethnic groups while
,"Sarlahi  district  on 
the  Tarai  has 
the 
least  homogeneity  with 
its  four 
largest  groups"
,comprising  just  36%  of  its  total  population.    The  diversity  of  population  in  terms  of


0,1
,ethnic/caste structure in the Nepal Tarai could be due to the heavy migration of hill people
,as well as an uncontrolled flow of Indian people over the last 40 years.
•,The  Hindu  religion  still  represents  more  than  80%  of  the  total  population  in  the  census
,"reports, though other religions are carving a substantial place in Nepali society since 1990."
,"Buddhism, Kirat, and Christianity have become increasingly reported religious affiliations"
,among  various  caste/ethnic  groups  in  Nepal.  A  special  feature  of  the  2001  census  is  its
,"provision  of  figures  for  religion  by  ethnic/caste  category,  allowing  a  much  more  detailed"
,accounting of the relationship between caste/ethnic and religious identities in Nepal.
•,Basic facts as represented in these figures are an essential foundation to our understanding
,"of 
larger 
societal 
and 
compositional 
trends. 
 
In 
recent  years, 
the  CBS  data  on"
,"caste/ethnicity, language and religion have become extremely useful for planners, teachers,"
,students and the people working in INGOs/NGOs for many reasons: i) they establish basic
,facts  and  figures  (crucially  including  socioeconomic  charactersitics)  about  the  various
,ethnic/caste  groups  living  in  different  parts  of  Nepal;  ii)  these  data  draw  attention  to  the
,specific development needs of particular social and cultural groups and aid the formulation
,of relevant programs; iii) basic data on caste/ethnicity aid the targetting of specific groups
,for  development  by  placing  them  withint  the  multi-ethnic  context  and  suggesting  groups
,"who  might  profit 
through  empowerment  and  changed  structures;  and 
 
iv) 
the  recent"
,availability  of  data  for  even  the  smallest  groups  allows  policy-makers  to  discover  those
,cultural  entities  who  may  require  special  state-sponsored  protection  for  such  things  as
,"language  and  culture.  Far  from  being  considered  a  detriment,  these  elements  of  Nepal's"
,historic cultural diversity should be considered as an inherent source of cultural and social
,wealth.
•,"Finally, it must be recorded that there will always remain room for improved data quality"
,on ethnic/caste groups and religion. Enumerators and supervisors who are responsible for
,collecting data in the field need extensive training programs in both Kathmandu and in the
,"field sites themselves. In the ideal programs, trainers will have a sound background in the"
,"anthropology 
and 
sociology  of  Nepal,  particularly 
in 
those 
critical 
areas 
such 
as"
,"caste/ethnicity,  language,  and  religion  which  can  become  volatile  when  ignored,  but  are"
,rightly  celebrated  when  respected.  Among  the  topics  essential  to  such  training  might  be


0,1,2,3,4,5
,foundational topics such as the concept of caste/ethnicity and its changing role in national,,,,
,society  and  a  familiarity  with  how  particular  groups  use  such  devices  as  family  and  clan,,,,
,"names or the titles put after names (such as Sharma, Choudhary, Mandal, Rai, Subba and so",,,,
on),to,indicate,their,identities  and,their  position  within  Nepal's  multi-ethnic  mosaic.
,Because  Nepal's  Tarai  captures  a  large  part  of  the  country's  ethnic/caste  diversity  and  its,,,,
,"complex  structuring,  special  attention  should  be  given  to  the  history  and  contemporary",,,,
,"organization of that region. Similarly, the understanding of the extremely complex manner",,,,
,in which religious identity is claimed and how it relates to actual practice is crucial.  Our,,,,
received categories are likely far too simple and yet faith and belief seem our best window,,,,,
"into the spirit of a people, certainly one which will enhance our appreciation of Nepal's true",,,,,
treasures.,,,,,
